Welcome to the Kokkos version of the Vector Particle-in-Cell code, VPIC 2.0!
VPIC is a 3D3V, fully relativistic, kinetic, performance-first PIC code for
solving the coupled Maxwell-Boltzmann system of equations. Utilizing the Kokkos
performance-portable framework, VPIC achieves high performance on multiple CPU
and GPU architectures.

The primary documentation for VPIC has moved to Sphinx and is hosted on GitHub
Pages [here](https://lanl.github.io/vpic-kokkos/index.html), and located in
`docs/`.  The documentation is still a work in progress, but hopefully
sufficient to get most users started.
